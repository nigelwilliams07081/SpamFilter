-i          [filepath]  Full path of input file to use.
-inputfile  [filepath]

-o          [filepath]  Full path of output file to use.
-outputfile [filepath]

-t          [integer]   Number of threads to use per worker. Higher numbers are better
-threads    [integer]   up to a point, depending on how many emails there are to process
                        and how many nodes are running.

-m          [integer]   Cap the execution time of the program to so many seconds.
-maxtime    [integer]   After this cap expires, it will call MPI_Abort() and then
                        attempt to exit the program.

--serialized            Run in serialized mode (-t must be 1 or omitted and -m must
                        be omitted). Serialized mode will not use ANY threads, 
                        including just to structure the flow of data. Use for 
                        debugging only. Very useful if program is behaving unexpectedly.
